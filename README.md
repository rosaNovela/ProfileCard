# ProfileCard
Profile Card | HTML5 & CSS3

Think of it as a digital business card.
A sleek, minimalist profile card component designed with a focus on clean UI and responsive web design. This project serves as a showcase of core CSS layout techniques—specifically the Box Model, Flexbox positioning, and custom hover transitions—without the use of external frameworks or libraries.

Styling: Implemented box-shadow layering and border-radius for a modern "card" aesthetic.
Optimization: Semantic HTML tags used for better accessibility (A11y) and SEO.
Design: Custom Google Fonts integration and a curated color palette.
